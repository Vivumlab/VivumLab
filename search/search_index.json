We are looking to provide an easy way for home users and IT technicians alike to deploy their favourite services on their own private infrastructure. We are currently in the development stage, focusing on the core services that will power VivumLab, now and in the future. What does VivumLab actually do? VivumLab deploys web services to a server. Deployment is managed by Ansible and the services are managed by Docker. To learn more, read our Installation documentation. What kind of help is VivumLab looking for? Make sure to check out the Required Jobs page, or you check out our Zulip chat. A message from VivumLab VivumLab wants to make deploying your own services as easy as possible; automating too much can cause more problems than is necessary. For that reason, we also want to encourage you to learn a bit about deploying your services, about responsible hosting, about strengthening communities, about taking back your own data, and making your own choices about where and how your data is used. A good place to start this, is to check out our documentation. Many hours of work have been put into this, and only for the benefit of others; including yourself. We understand that documentation tends to be daunting to some, so we've made sure that the documentation is relevant, and set out in an easy to undestand way. We also want you to become a part of this community and to help make VivumLab better; and not just a better piece of software, but a better place for everyone. Make sure to visit our Zulip chat, and say Hi to the community. This is an exciting time for us. We are glad you're here, and hope to see you around the interwebs. Thank you for trying VivumLab!

Navigate it quickly by using the Table of Contents or the search bar; searching is easy, and makes you look cool.. Just saying. Note: VivumLab does assume some prior knowledge on behalf of the user, if you do not have this knowledge using VivumLab will not be impossible but you may find it hard to troubleshoot any issues you may have. We assume you know or understand the basics of: 1. your server operating system (where VivumLab will store your services) 2. your client operating system (the computer that you use VivumLab from) 3. Access via SSH 4. Pointing your domain ('A' record) to the required IP address FAQs Does VivumLab cost anything? No, and as long as it remains open source, it never will. If you paid money for this service, get your money back. Why did we fork HomeLabOS? HomeLabOS is a great project, and while we are very similar, we differ in some core values and (general) project direction. VivumLab is an alternative to HomeLabOS, not a replacement; We would like to suggest that you test both projects and see which one suits you; everyone is different and deserves the freedom to choose. If you decide to stick with VivumLab, then Welcome to the community; lets do some amazing things together. VivumLab and Open Source We just want to start by saying open source is very important, a free (as in freedom) internet, is something worth protecting. That being said, you may have noticed that some of the services we provide are open source, and some are not; while VivumLab advocates for and prefers open source projects, we undestand that sometimes a closed source project is required or desired by the user. The least we can do is keep VivumLab open source and free for further generations to come. VivumLab and supported software VivumLab supports deploying to Debian and CentOS based systems; since RaspberryPI OS is based on Debian, VivumLab should work. While it is theortically possible to deploy to other systems with some code changes, supporting niche or closed source systems are not a great priority for VivumLab. Changes to support such systems are welcome, should a developer wish to provide the code and support for the system. Currently, VivumLab can be run from a Linux PC or a Macintosh PC: VivumLab currently does not officially support Windows. For the more tech savvy users, it is possible to run VivumLab on a windows machine using Windows Subsystem for Linux . However support is not official, and it is beyond the scope of this document to provide instructions; as such, your results may vary. Troubleshooting - Access/ Web I have pointed my domain at my IP but accessing the domain returns nothing If you ping your domain, do you get the IP you expect? If not you have DNS issues . Get those resolved before moving on. If you ping your subdomain, do you get the IP you expect? If not you have DNS issues . You probably don't have a wildcard set up. If you're still having issues with your domain, contact your domain registrar (whom you purchased your domain from); there is a good chance that they have their own documentation regarding this. Does the IP you expect actually lead to port 80 on your server? You may need to set up port forwarding on your router, unblock some ports on your modem, or contact your ISP to see if they are being blocked. If these aren't an option for you, try the bastion host set up. Does the domain you're trying to access match what is listed in the Traefik dashboard? If you don't see your domain under the 'HTTP' section in Traefik, then you have something configured wrong. Are your services running? Check docker ps and systemctl status SERVICENAME on the server. E.g. systemctl status jellyfin Are your services listed in the Traefik dashboard? Check http://127.0.0.1:8181/ If you have followed these instructions and you are STILL having issues, ask in the VivumLab Zulip chat or open an issue on Github . !!! Note: The documentation for VivumLab represents hours of work by the developers. Do not be offended if you ask a question, and are redirected back to the documentation. It is entirely for your own benefit; no one elses'. I get a 404 If you're up and running, but accessing the server returns a 404, check the Traefik dashboard . Each service under the Http page has a section. The hostname inside Host() in the rule column is the hostname that Traefik is listening to for that particular service. You need to be able to ping that hostname from your computer, and you should get back the IP address of your server. Once that is the case, accessing the domain name in a browser should load the respective service. Traefik serves based on domain names, not IP addresses. It has to know what service you want to return. You need to be able to access the domain name in order for Traefik to serve the correct service. No Traefik Dashboard If you can't even access the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8181, check the status of the VivumLab service to give you some insight into what the issue is. e.g: systemctl status vivumlab or: docker ps | grep traefik which should provide similar output to this: 8f00f6b3cdb6 traefik \"/traefik\" 13 hours ago Up 13 hours 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8181->8080/tcp vivumlab_traefik_1 If there is no obvious issue, contact the community on Zulip Services Not Appearing in Traefik, Bad Gateway, or Services Restarting If you don't see the services listed in the Traefik dash, or if Traefik returns a page that just says Bad Gateway , that usually means DNS and everything is correct, but the service itself is having problems. SSH into the server and run systemctl status SERVICE_NAME e.g: systemctl status jellyfin This should show you any Docker logs relevant to that service. In the case of a service running multiple containers, you may want more detail from a specific container. Find the container name with docker ps | grep SERVICENAME then access the logs with docker logs -f --tail 500 CONTAINERNAME . E.g: docker ps | grep jellyfin and: docker logs -f --tail 500 jellyfin_jellyfin_1 SSL Not working Traefik generates SSL certs via LetsEncrypt, and LetsEncrypt has rate limiting. So it may take several days before all of your services get valid SSL certs generated for them. You can tail the logs of the traefik container (as mentioned previously) to see the status of its generation. Troubleshooting - Server/ config vlab command throws a docker related error Make sure VivumLab successfully installed docker on the server. If its not installed, try installing it manually. Make sure you are running the latest docker and docker compose on both your client and server. The versions installed via your Operating Systems' package manager may be outdated; here is some information to help you get started. VivumLab may attempt to do this for you, in a future release. Check VivumLab status on the server and make sure it is loaded and active. e.g: systemctl status vivumlab Make sure the admin user specified during vlab config is created. e.g: compgen -u If the user isn't listed, run the following commands (on the server) to make one and add it to the sudo and docker groups. sudo adduser <username> sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> sudo usermod -aG docker <username> What config values are available, and what do they do? HTTPS_ONLY Stops the specified service from serving any access over an unsecure (HTTP) connection. Most services deployed with VivumLab will redirect wherever possible, to a secure (HTTPS) connection without any intervention from the user. As such, this option is available only for unique cases. Most users will never have to use this. AUTH Allows third party services to assume control of authentication for a specified service. Some, if not most services deployed with VivumLab, make use of their own authentication system to protect the information stored therein; you may need to enter a username/email and password to access it. This option allows Authelia to control authentication for services that otherwise may not have any. For example, the dashboard used for VivumLab is called SUI, and typical does not have authentication. Setting auth to True, allows SUI to be protected. This is completely optional, but available if you want it. DOMAIN Sets a different, custom domain. All services (by default) are served on servicename.domain.tld ; assuming that you are serving VivumLab services on the domain 'magicfinger.com', and you were deploying the awesome open source media center 'Jellyfin', the default URL would look like this: jellyfin.magicfinger.com . The 'domain' option for Jellyfin can be changed if the user desires Jellyfin to be served on another domain, eg. magictoe.com. VivumLab allows the change of the sitename, but no subdomains (future releases may support this). In this example, once the domain option is changed Jellyfin will be served on magictoe.com not jellyfin.magictoe.com . The domain option is also useful if the user wants a specific service served on the top level domain, and not on it's default subdomain. Using the same example, if the domain option is set to magicfinger.com , Jellyfin will be served on magicfinger.com , instead of the default jellyfin.magicfinger.com SUBDOMAIN Sets a different, custom subdomain. Similarly to the domain option, the subdomain option allows the user to customise the subdomain for their service. Unlike the domain, it is simple, not complex. The subdomain option defaults to the servicename; using the previous example, the default subdomain is jellyfin , making the default URL jellyfin.magicfinger.com . Changing the subdomain option to media would allow jellyfin to be reached on media.magicfinger.com instead. VERSION Sets the image version of the docker image used. VivumLab acknowledges that some versions of specific softwares may be more desirable than others; this option allows the user to specify another version. Please note that the default value is the version that VivumLab has been tested with, and has shown to work the best at the time of testing. if the user decides to change the version, VivumLab can not guarantee that the adjusted version will work. I can't find certain config values like Authelia Check your config/vault.yml file. If it's encrypted just run vlab decrypt , and attempt to access it again. Is it OK to manually edit my settings/ files? Yes, but note that isn't specifically necessary to edit the config/ files directly, or worry about where the config values are. Use of vlab get will access the variable correctly regardless of which config file it lives in. eg. vlab get jellyfin.domain Use of vlab set will set the variable correctly,regardless of which config file eg. vlab set jellyfin.domain=magicfinger.com I get a exec user process caused 'exec format' error You may be trying to run AMD code on ARM infrastructure. Make sure you have set arm to True. e.g: vlab get arm You can set it with vlab set arm=True , or you can edit your config file. e.g: Set this to true if you are deploying to an ARM infrastructure, such as a Raspberry Pi. arm: True How do I tell if a service is enabled? On your server, run systemctl status servicename , as root, or sudo systemctl status servicename as another user. E.g: systemctl status jellyfin I get Unit servicename.service could not be found. The service was not deployed. Enable the desired service. eg. vlab set jellyfin enable=True Alternatively, edit your settings/ files, and set enable to true for the respective service. e.g: jellyfin: enable: True If I don't have a domain, what do I enter for the domain field? You can use Vivumlab fully inside your network, without an external domain. Simply make up a domain that ends in .local and enter that as your domain in host_vars/myserver , for example myvivumlab.local will work just fine, but there are some small changes that you will need to make. VivumLab will generate a file called vivumlab_hosts on the server, located in the VivumLab root folder; You can use the entries in this file to add to your computer's hosts override file ( /etc/hosts on *nix based OS'), or to map on your router or DNS server as DNS overrides. Ultimately, if you used the example fake domain given above and you enabled the Jellyfin service, you can access it at jellyfin.myvivumlab.local once you have your DNS overrides set up. Can I use a 32 bit OS? Yes, but you shouldn't. A quick Google search will return some options for you; however VivumLab does not officially support it. Older version of Raspberry Pi OS (previously Raspbian) are 32 bit and in theory it is possible to use this OS; but again, VivumLab does not officially support it.","title":"Troubleshooting / FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ-Troubleshoot/#troubleshooting-faq","text":"This is the Frequently Asked Questions section.

This is in addition to and separate from the Backup service included within VivumLab, which backs up your personal computers to the VivumLab servers. Get access to an S3 Bucket Ideally you want your backups to be offsite, so really the best case scenario would be to find a friend also running VivumLab, and trade S3 access with them. Alternatively, you could pay Amazon and use their S3 service. Use your own S3 Backing up to your own infrastructure does not protect your data, especially in the case of server failure or data corruption. However it is still possible to use your own S3 bucket; this may be useful due to Restic's snapshotting. So while this won't give you an offsite backup, it will still provide timed snapshots to access old versions of files. View your logs for the Minio service (eg. vivumlab_minio_1) and copy the AccessKey and SecretKey out of the logs. Run vlab decrypt to decrypt the vault, and put the keys into under the s3_access_key and s3_secret_key variables in the decrypted settings/vault.yml file. Now login to your Minio with the same access and secret key values and create a bucket called restic-backups . Finally run vlab update to copy your new settings up to your VivumLab server. !!! Note: When self hosting your own S3, its good practice to keep good backups of the S3 data files as well. Configure the Backup Service To configure the backup service, 4 parameters are required; they are: s3_path s3_access_key s3_secret_key s3_backup_password (please generate a strong password) You can set all these parameters as follows: vlab set s3_path <S3 path> vlab set s3_access_key <S3 access key> vlab set s3_secret_key <S3 secret key> vlab set s3_backup_password <your S3 password> You can also manually set the required S3 parameters in settings/vault.yml and settings/config.yml Run vlab decrypt to decrypt the vault before editing it, and set the respective parameters. Finalize any changes with vlab deploy Once these are set, VivumLab will back up all it's core data every night at 4 AM. Restoring Backups To restore your most recent backup, simply run vlab restore ; then proceed with the normal install step of running vlab deploy . This should result in a fully working VivumLab setup with the backed up data. Alternatively you can work directly with the Restic backups through its own 'docker shell' (see below). Accessing the restic shell, enables you to run commands like restic snapshots to list all your snapshots. To restore (for example) just your NextCloud data, you can run docker exec restic_restic_1 restic restore latest --include /data/nextcloud --target /data/nextcloud .

We are glad you are here. VivumLab is designed to be run from a client computer. It will setup, and configure your remote server, with minimal intervention on your behalf. There have been reports that VivumLab works when transferred to the remote server, and run from there; however, VivumLab is not designed for this, and as such, this is not supported; running VivumLab in this way may have undesirable results; and does not provide any foreseeable benefits. Beta Software Warning This software has not reached version 1.0 and should therefore be considered unstable/beta. If you like getting your hands dirty in early versions of software, this is for you; stability is not guaranteed. Using this software may render your data unusable; using this software is at your own discretion. To ensure the safety of your data, consider: - making regular backups - testing software without your own data Requirements Server A suitable OS: Ubuntu Server 16 and above Debian 9 and above CentOS 6 and above Raspbery Pi OS 2017-08-16 and above (in theory) sudo must be available Passwordless SSH via SSH keys working Warning If you are running on an ARM infrastructure such as Raspberry PI, ensure arm is set to 'true' in the config.yml file, on the client computer. Client Computer Docker (installed and working) !!! Note: The idea is that you deploy from your personal computer to the server. This way your settings are saved on your personal computer, which can be used to re-build the server and restore from backups if anything goes wrong. Domain Name Configure your domains' A type DNS record to point at your server's IP address. This is applicable for subdomains as well, eg. *.test.yourdomain.com would work. !!! Note: Configuring your domain is (in a sense) optional as: - you can use Tor to access your services without registering a domain - you can fake it by adding DNS overrides to your /etc/hosts file on *nix and MacOS if needed !!! Note: Domains are preferred An actual domain is highly recommended, as: - service clients may not work through TOR - certain services may not work through TOR - private DNS services eventually cost more than getting your own domain - public DNS services are unreliable - public domains tend to be high maintenance DNS Settings You need to point your domain and your *.domain (wildcard) to the IP address that your VivumLab deployment is accessible at. HOWEVER, If you are using: - a bastion host; point at the bastion hosts' IP - your home server; use your home IP address !!! Note: You need to set up a wildcard DNS entry (*.domain) because all the services are served off of subdomains. i.e. The Plex service defaults to plex.yourdomain , and the Hubzilla service defaults to hubzilla.yourdomain , etc Warning If you are not using a real domain, but using /etc/hosts entries to 'fake' it, wildcard entries will not work in /etc/hosts . Instead you will need to create an entry for each service enabled. The vivumlab_hosts file (located in the remote/deploy servers' VivumLab root folder), is available to you for this purpose. Changing your domain It is possible to change your domain: Using the command line, run: vlab set domain=<your.new.domain> e` then run vlab deploy to finalise the changes alternatively, you can set the appropriate service settings in settings/config.yml to True, and then run vlab deploy eg. domain: <your.domain> Port Forwarding Ports '80' and '443' will need to be forwarded for VivumLab to work.. This is typically only necessary with infrastructure that you have direct networking control of; the most common scenario here, would be a home server. Note you do not need to deal with port forwarding or firewalls, if you are using a bastion server or TOR access Cloud Bastion Server Rather than pointing the domain at your home IP and having to manage DDNS, you can utilize a cloud server to act as a bastion host via Tinc vpn and nginx. Fore more information, look here S3 Account S3 is Amazon's Simple Storage Service which VivumLab can optionally use to back up to. You can use Amazon's service, or one of many other S3 compatible providers. You can also back up to another VivumLab instance if that other instance is running Minio, a self-hosted S3 service. Manual Set-up Download the master version to your client computer and extract the folder. From inside the folder run ./vlab install_cli now you can run any vlab command directly. Otherwise just append ./ to all further vlab commands. Note If you are using VivumLab to provision a bastion server, run: vlab terraform From inside the VivumLab folder, set up the initial config: vlab config Note You will be prompted for the basic information to get started. The passwords entered here will be stored on the client computer and are used by ansible to configure your server. After you enter the information, VivumLab will configure your local docker images and build your initial settings/ files. Once you have updated your settings simply deploy VivumLab with vlab deploy . You can run vlab deploy as many times as needed to get your settings correct. You can check http://127.0.0.1:8181 in a browser to see the Traefik dashboard. See a full list of commands on the Commands page Enabling Services Run vlab set SERVICENAME.enable=true where SERVICENAME is the name of the service you want to enable. - eg vlab set jellyfin.enable=true Then run vlab deploy again. That's it. It will take a few minutes for your server to deploy and start the relevant services. Warning Some services expose 'setup' pages upon deployment. If you don't complete the set up step, there is a chance someone else could beat you to it. If they do just run vlab reset_one SERVICENAME then vlab deploy again and the service will reset to it's freshly installed state. You can SSH into the server, and run systemctl status SERVICENAME where SERVICENAME is the name of the service you want to check is running. It will show you status and/or errors of the service. Example systemctl status miniflux Syncing Settings via Git VivumLab will automatically keep the settings/ folder in sync with a git repo if it has one. So you can create a private repo on your Gitea instance for example, then clone that repo over the settings folder. Now any changes you make to settings/ files will be commited and pushed to that git repo whenever you run vlab deploy , vlab update or vlab config . Backing up your Vault Password Danger This bit is important. Your vault password exists at ~/.vlab_vault_pass for the user you ran the script as (possibly the user you are logged in as, right now). Make sure to back this password up somewhere safe, and ideally not in your settings/ folder. If someone gains access to your settings/ folder and the vault password, bad things can happen. Store them separately.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"core/Installation/#installation","text":"Firstly, thanks for trying VivumLab. We are glad you are here.

And by extension, VivumLab. Ephemeral - This storage disappears when the container is shut down. It's used for things like temporary storage for a containers services. Volume - These are mounted by the container and 'map' a physical (host, ubuntu) directory, to a containers internal directory. Volumes are used for persistent storage. For instance, Mysql's DB storage directories are mapped to host folders so that even if the container restarts, the db's storage exists when it restarts. You'll see these referenced in docker-compose.yml files like this: volumes: - /var/vivumlab/serviceName:/MyFiles This mapping of a volume means that the container, and it's software can access the contents of /var/vivumlab/serviceName by accessing it's own /MyFiles directory. NAS - Network Attached Storage volume(s) - NAS Volumes - are volumes, but they're controlled, in part, by VivumLab. If you enable NAS storage in your config, and provide valid credentials to your NAS, VivumLab will take care of mounting your NAS for you. Understanding Collection Auto-Volumes VivumLab provides a number of services designed to act on, or share, collections of data. For instance, Airsonic is designed to provide you a web interface to your music collection. But Airsonic isn't alone. Jellyfin, Plex and Funkwhale all provide that same access to your music collection. To enable these services to share access to a common collection of media (or documents, etc.) VivumLab creates, and maintains a series of collection folders that are auto-mapped by docker when the service is brought online. VivumLab uses the following Collection Auto-volumes Backups Books Documents Downloads Music Pictures temp Video In general, if it makes sense for a VivumLab service to have access to a given collection, you'll find that it's automatically set up for you. For instance, out of the box, Airsonic has access to the Music volume, and Nextcloud has access to the Documents volume. These folders are maintained by VivumLab inside the directory specified by the storage_dir configuration variable. Understanding the storage_dir config variable Your settings/config.yml file contains a variable named storage_dir that defaults to the directory /mnt/nas . Despite the name, this folder does not have to be a NAS Mount . If you're not using a NAS, because you've got an external hard drive attached, or an internal raid array you've already mounted that's fine. Just set the storage_dir config variable to the directory where you have mounted your storage. Whenever you enable a service, VivumLab verifies that the storage_dir contains directories that match the collection auto-volumes mentioned above. Setting up and mounting storage is a complex and potentially destructive task. As such, it is outside the scope of VivumLab to do this; this is the intention of the developers. !!! Please research, and be careful. Migrating storage At some point, you may need to change where your storage_dir points, either because you've run out of space, or moved to a NAS. The following are high-level instructions on what you need to do to migrate your data from one storage asset to another. Run systemctl stop docker on your VivumLab server to disable all VivumLab services that might try to read or write to your existing storage directory Mount your new storage somewhere other than /mnt/nas .. eg. /media/newHd Copy or Move the contents of your /mnt/nas directory to the newly mounted directory. Edit your. settings/config.yml and change storage_dir to point at the newly mounted directory. Run systemctl start docker on your VivumLab server to reenable docker Run vlab update to re-deploy VivumLab with the new storage_dir set. Understanding NAS configuration for VivumLab Different VivumLab services operate on libraries of media (Airsonic, Plex, and Piwigo as examples). Since these libraries can be large, it makes sense to keep them on another machine with lots of storage. NAS shares are mounted on the Vivumlab host under /mnt/nas , which defaults to /mnt/nas . By default, NAS is disabled, and the services that can use it will instead use local folders under /mnt/nas . For example, Emby will map /mnt/nas/Video/TV and /mnt/nas/Video/Movies into its container, and Paperless will mount /mnt/nas/Documents . Check the docker-compose files for each service to see what directories are used. VivumLab has a NAS section in the settings/config.yml file. This allows you to specify the connection details and credentials to access your NAS. These details are used in conjunction with the storage_dir variable to create and maintain /etc/fstab entries. !!! NOTE: VivumLab is configured to write /etc/fstab entries that mount your NAS folders within, or on top of the storage_dir directory** Be careful not to mount your NAS folders over existing files in your storage_dir or everyone will be very confused. NAS Configuration To configure your NAS, edit the # NAS Config section of settings/config.yml . Your NAS options are: nas_enable to True VivumLab will start maintaining the mounting of your NAS for you, if set to True , and after you run vlab update nas_host : this is the IP or hostname of your NAS server/device. ie: 192.168.1.130 nas_mount_type : your options here are nfs , cifs , or smb . While Ubuntu can mount just about anything, VivumLab only knows how to maintain those three connection types. nas_share_path : this represents the path to the shared directory on your NAS. nas_user : username to authenticate with. *defaults to the value of default_username nas_pass : password to authenticate with. nas_workgroup : Workgroup needed for some SMB/CIFS shares. run vlab deploy when complete, to enable the updated NAS configuration.

How to Manually Add Services to Vivumlab Create Role Folder Copy an existing role folder like 'inventario' from the roles/ folder, then adapt the values as needed. Use hardcoded volume paths All mounted docker volumes should point to a folder named after the service that is using it, and located under /var/vivumlab . Add Service to Documentation Create a Documentation Page Each service should have it's own page within the docs/software/ folder. Use existing docs as a template. Link to Documentation Page Update the mkdocs.yml file with a reference to the newly created doc file. Add Service to Inventory File The service needs to be added within group_vars/all . Place it in the services: section in alphabetical order. Add Service to README The service should be added under the list of Available Software . Add Service to config.yml.j2 In the config template roles/vivumlab_config/templates/config.yml.j2 the service should be added in alphabetical order under the # Services List section. How to Debug a New Service After a new service has been deployed, run systemctl status SERVICE_NAME to see how it's doing. - eg. systemctl status jellyfin If it's not running with an error like (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE) Grab the value of the ExecStart line, and run it by hand.

Then tag those tasks as with a # MIGRATION vX.X comment. The next tagged release after the version in the comment, these tasks will be removed. Example Gitea had an incorrect path in it's docker-compose yml file. It was pointing the /data mount at /var/lab/vivumlab/gitea instead of /var/vivumlab/gitea where it should have been. So two tasks were created, one to copy the folder to it's proper place, the next to make sure the old folder was absent. The first task will fail if the folder to be copied doesn't exist, which will be the case for new users, or users who have already ran the migration once.

Fork the right repo : make sure you forked the 'dev' branch 2. Label the PR appropriately : * Add the label 'Testing needed' , if the code requires testing that you are unable to perform yourself. This is common, and it is good to let others test and give feedback. * Add the label 'Work in Progress' if the code isn't quite finished. This would be applicable if you had small (or large) amounts of code that is missing, doesn't work as expected, or maybe just isn't quite right. Use this label, if help isn't necessary or expected. * It is expected that if collaboration or suggestions are offered, they are received and handled well; keep the community healthy . * Add the label 'Help needed' , if you want help with the PR. Everyone needs help at some point, so use the community; It's why we are here. 3. Update the documentation : If the code requires the user to interact differently with either VivumLab or the service, then educate them; irrespective of their technical skill level. This is a REQUIREMENT, and will be ENFORCED 4. Make sure your code lints : simply speaking, make your code neat and make sure it is formatted correctly. 5. Issue the pull request : As mentioned before, creating a corresponding issue assists with tracking changes and keeps the code focused. It is extremely rare that a PR is accepted without a corresponding issue. 6. Use consistent coding style : At times this will be unavoidable (eg. YAML files); irrespective of this, to ensure ease of updating and future contribution of code from other community members. it is expected that: * any contributed code: * employs a responsible use of whitespace * is appropriately commented * Names (of variables, functions etc.): * should be formatted appropriately * mindfully designed * relevant to VivumLab, and its pre-existing codebase Pre-commit Pre-commit assists the developer in producing readable, auditable code.

Information Docker Image: !!! LINK TO DOCKER IMAGE/ DOCKER HUB !!! Current Image Version: latest SETUP What is this? Authelia is a multi-factor, authentication proxy. Used in conjunction with traefik (which vivumlab already uses) it secures your vivumlab services behind authentication. By default you must authenticate with username and password, and at least one other 'factor' ie: one-time password from, say, google authenticator a registered security key, for instance a YubiKey or something similar A Push message to your mobile device through the Duo service When enabled, Traefik will forward most requests (more on this later) to Authelia for authentication. Once you login to Authelia, it will redirect you to the service you requested. For instance, if you navigate to firefly.yourdomain.com, traefik will auto-redirect you to auth.yourname.com for authentication. Once you authenticate, it will redirect you back to firefly.yourdomain.com. On the backend, Authelia authenticates users against a userdb.yml file. The passwords in this file are hashed with sha512. If you need to manually edit the userdb.yml file, you'll need to create new password hashes with this command: docker run authelia/authelia:latest authelia hash-password 'YOUR NEW PASSWORD' | awk '{print $3}''Your new Password Here' The docker image comes from authelia/authelia:latest and should support arm devices. Prerequisites Note: Authelia is written in GO, and there is a known GO issue with certain Linux Kernel Versions. Specifically, Ubuntu 20.04 ships with a default kernel of 5.3.0-46 (as of 4/28/2020) Using this kernel will result in a constantly-dying-and-restarting Authelia container with a note that shows Runtime: mlock of signal stack failed.... Update your kernel to 5.3.15+, 5.4.2+, or 5.5+ You must upgrade your docker hosts' kernel to one of those versions for Authelia to work Authelia requires a working SMTP server to authenticate new users and register devices. Configuration VivumLab ships with intelligent defaults for Authelia. However, there are some choices you must make. In config.yml, there is an Authelia section. The configuration options are explained below: Authelia configuration options log_level: defaults to debug, you can set to 'error' as well use_username: Defaults to true. if true, your authellia login name is your config.yml's default username: admin . max: retries: this is the maximum number of times someone can fail to authenticate within a given time frame before being locked out. (defaults 5) retries_in_time: this is the time frame that a user has to fail X times in before they're banned. (Defaults to 2min.) retries_ban_time: How long a user is prohibited from logging in after failing X times in Y mintes, per the first two variables. (defaults to 5 minutes) These three combined (as defaulted), means that a user who fails to authenticate 5 times within 2 minutes is banned for 5 minutes. default: factor_count: The number of authentication factors required to login. Options are: bypass - Authelia will not require authentication. one_factor - only a user/pass is required. two_factor - ( default ) Username/password as well as a second factor is required. deny - Authelia will prevent login and access to the services. cookie expiration: How long the authentication cookie is good for. (_default: 1hr ) cookie inactivity: How long the cookie can sit, without being refreshed (ie: user is active) before expiring. (_Defaults to 5min ) policy: This is the default policy for any un-named service. This is the policy for everything unless overriten by other service rules. Overriding the default policy /var/vivumlab/Authelia/Authelia_config.yml file is the source of truth for post-deployment configuration settings. If you wish to override the default policy, stated in config.yml, you'll need to hand edit this configuration file and restart Authelia. You probably only need to do this if there is a service that you want to excempt from two-factor authentication, or excempt from Authelia all together. About 100 lines into the config you'll find a section that looks like this: rules: - domain: portainer.vivumlab.xyz policy: one_factor - domain: auth.vivumlab.xyz policy: bypass - domain: \"*.vivumlab.xyz\" policy: { { Authelia.default.factor_count } } Right above this section in your config file is a well documented explination of how this works. Out of the box, the standard config bypasses Authelia for Authelia itself, and drops portainer down to a single-factor. All other subdomains are locked to the default factor-count, with the final rule. Note, the order of rules matters. The first matching rule wins. If you wish to set a subdomain/service to use something other than your configured default, simply add a clause to the rules section containing at least the following: - domain: YourExampleSubdomainHere.vivumlab.xyz policy: Whatever Policy You'd like for this domain. Note, Authelia does understand the concept of groups, and can limit some services to particular groups, ie: administarators. You might use this to limit say, portainer, to admins.

To do this: 1. go to your Hubzilla instance, and on the login screen, click register 2. create an account using the admin email that was set during installation. Unless you modified the docker-compose file, the default admin email will be admin@your.domain.com check out the **Access** part of these docs, if you're unsure, which domain you used. 3. Unless you have some immediate administration tasks that need finishing, log out and create your own user account using your own email address. 4. Now you can log back into the admin account, and play around. I suggest setting the verify email option, or closing registrations to your hub. Step 4 is a suggestion/ reminder from VivumLab.

DEVELOPERS : make sure that you include any information that the user requires to get started, below. !!! !!! Below are some examples with headings, and with some example instructions !!! About Nextcloud can be a beast to setup. Therefore, VivumLab does as much as it can to provide intelligent defaults, and common configuration settings out of the box. Specifically, VivumLab configures Nextcloud in the following ways: * Postgres as the default database server * Redis for caching * Nextcloud 18, served by Apache * Docker is set to run the main Nextcloud container as the same Uid/Gid that mounts your NAS. (or your non-root server-user's UID/GID) * 'App Store' Access is enabled * Default Username is pulled from your config/vault yaml file * Default Password is pulled from your config/vault yaml file * Mounts/Volumes - these are all configured to persist across container restarts. - /var/vivumlab/nextcloud/apps - host accessible volume containing self-installed apps. - /var/vivumlab/nextcloud/config - host accessible volume containing configuration. - when necessary, users can directly edit the config.php file - for instance, to fix the login-loop bug with mobile apps. - /var/vivumlab/nextcloud/themes - host accessible volume containing custom theme files. - /var/vivumlab/nextcloud/webroot - host accessible volume containing the actuall nextcloud php files, and user-data root folders. - /mnt/nas/ - mounted internally as /mnt/vivumlab Configuration Notes Use https_only After you enable Nextcloud, it is recommended to set force https_only on the Nextcloud service to true. However, if you're using the http provisioning system for LetsEncrypt, you'll need to wait to enable https_only until the cert has been generated. Auto installation takes a few minutes Once make has finished running, it will take a few minutes - depending on your servers' hardware capabilities - to finish setting up Nextcloud. VivumLab pre-configures: * Database * Default User & Password - check your config and vault files for details on what these are set to. Post Installation Configuration Nextcloud, as an application, is designed to silo users' data apart from one-another. (this is a good thing). However, this causes issues when you want to allow users to access a common data store - like a NAS. To facilitate this, VivumLab mounts your hosts' /mnt/nas in the container as the /mnt/vivumlab folder. Once you've installed and configured Nextcloud, you'll need to take the following steps to make your /mnt/nas available to users: Launch settings, and select Apps. Select 'disabled' apps Click the enable button next to 'External Storage Support' Logout - Do not skip this step. Login and navigate to Settings -> External Storage ( Under Administration ) Add a new External Storage with the following configuration Folder Name: VivumLab External Storage: Local Authentication: None Configuration: /mnt/vivumlab Click the check icon. Profit! After completing these steps, your Users will see a VivumLab folder under files. More advanced users can probably re-map the default file locations for pictures etc. to be under the VivumLab folder.
