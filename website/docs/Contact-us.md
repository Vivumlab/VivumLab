# Contacting VivumLab

Thank you for attempting to reach us. Our small development team is passionate about this project, and we hope that you will be too.

## Code Issues/ Suggestions/ Requests
We look forward to hearing from you; and to those of you that want to contribute to VivumLab, we are always happy to review and discuss any contributions.

In regards to contributions, code or otherwise, the [VivumLab GitHub page](https://github.com/Vivumlab/VivumLab) is the best place to open an issue (or a suggestion). The [VivumLab Zulip Chat](https://vivumlab.zulipchat.com/) is also available for discussion; however opening an issue on GithHub will help the project stay on track.

## Community Issues/ Complaints/ Feedback
VivumLab prefers that any issues involving the community be referred to one of the Community Leaders via the [VivumLab Zulip Chat](https://vivumlab.zulipchat.com/). Feel free to ask for further information in the 'Community Support' thread.

## Disclaimer/ Notes

We suggest that you consult the VivumLab [Code of Conduct](Code-of-Conduct.md) for more information on how your enquiry, and information are handled.

Please understand that everyone here is busy, and that this is an open source project. That means that all the code is available for you to audit; however, it also means that the team is volunteering their time to this project, so understandably there may be some short delays in getting back to you.
